Ok.
So now that we have a seperate csv file of all entries, I want to do a pass that converts that into a finer grain listing
I want to include the submission fee (if it exists), keywords, genre, identity focus, offering publication, deadline, prize, judge, submission fee

Recidencies will need to be processed slightly differently
possibly in a different database

but for presses, chapbooks and journals + anthologies : they seem to follow the same rules

/ (Deadline: Date) or Date Range or Year-Round or Now / Genre / submission fee (if it exists) / Series Editor: {} / Prize (if it exists) / Judge (if it exists)

Genre may include by {identity} clause
Prize may include + Publication [by publication]

at the very least everything here seems seprated by / so that makes it easy to extract indivisual elements
and we can probably have a system of regx for each type see fits each category!

tiz-ight!

Let's rest on this....

_____________________

this is cool. So I can scan a single entry in our base data, see if it matches against a range of regex and get back a custom
value based on it. Here is the thing. Now we move back a step and see how this system relates to multiple datatypes and points to a specific (or range) values within our base entry.

This problem is in part related to the complexity of our data entries themselves.

What I think I want for (and it is expressed within this data, so I have to accomidate for it somehow), is:
Sub Open Date
Sub Close Date
Currently Open
Rolling Submissions (Year Round)
