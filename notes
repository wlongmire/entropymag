Ok.
So now that we have a seperate csv file of all entries, I want to do a pass that converts that into a finer grain listing
I want to include the submission fee (if it exists), keywords, genre, identity focus, offering publication, deadline, prize, judge, submission fee

Recidencies will need to be processed slightly differently
possibly in a different database

but for presses, chapbooks and journals + anthologies : they seem to follow the same rules

/ (Deadline: Date) or Date Range or Year-Round or Now / Genre / submission fee (if it exists) / Series Editor: {} / Prize (if it exists) / Judge (if it exists)

Genre may include by {identity} clause
Prize may include + Publication [by publication]

at the very least everything here seems seprated by / so that makes it easy to extract indivisual elements
and we can probably have a system of regx for each type see fits each category!

tiz-ight!

Let's rest on this....
