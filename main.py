# so we have sections are divided into anchor tags with <h3><b> within them. One word categories.
# everything from there to the next example (or the pdf img for end) is a section of types of
# submissions.

# from there indivisual entries are listed as 

# with variations of course. What we can do is stripe this of price and use it regardless.

# The real fun comes in doing text searched of the accompaning links and maybe providing some text analysis of those pages
# for examples of writing.

# This is a great first step though. Next I will need to seperate the entries into sections (beautiful soup reference/ css selectors)
# if I can just have a list of all entries with the approparte type beside it I will be in a great place to make a dump of the data.
